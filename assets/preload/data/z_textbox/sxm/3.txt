matt:ang:1:GOD DAMN IT!!!!
rsh:con:-1:Hey, like, what's wrong dude?
matt:ang:1:I CAN'T! I CAN'T BEAT THIS PIECE#OF SHIT!!!!!
rsh:con:-1:That's a bit rude...
rsh:ser:-1:There's no point in getting angry. this guy#is physically unable to loose
matt:down:1:...
matt:down:1:...what?
rsh:ser:-1:'That kid' is boyfriend.
rsh:ser:-1:Every single being#in this universe that has challenged him#was defeated and stuff
rsh:ser:-1:That's because any time he looses a battle#he dies.
matt:normal:1:!!!
rsh:smug:-1:But death does not mean end to him, every#time he dies he is given the choice to#reset time to a certain state
rsh:smug:-1:That means that from our perspective, there#is no possible outcome in which the flow#of time continues after he's defeated
matt:down:1:What the hell
matt:ang:1:I've been fighting for nothing?
rsh:smug:-1:Your power has increased drastically.#I wouldn't call that nothing man
rsh:normal:-1:Hey, I'll tell you what.
rsh:smug:-1:We can't beat him but we can sure as#heck give him a challenge.
matt:normal:1:You wanna sing together?
rsh:smug:-1:Yeah man! with my power and your speed,#he's bound to have a bad time.
rsh:ser:-1:If that makes you feel better of course...
matt:up:1:You know what? Let's do this!
